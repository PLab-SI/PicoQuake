## Noise performance

PicoQuake can be used to profile vibrations of very low magnitude, due to the low-noise accelerometer used. We evaluated the noise performance of a stationary PicoQuake at room temperature for two configurations:

- Low noise configuration: 500 Hz sample rate, 42 Hz filter, +-2 g range
    - X axis noise: 0.43 *mg RMS*
    - Y axis noise: 0.46 *mg RMS*
    - Z axis noise: 1.17 *mg*
- Full performance configuration: 4 kHz sample rate, 2 kHz filter, +-16 g range
    - X axis noise: 1.88 *mg RMS*
    - Y axis noise: 2.21 *mg RMS*
    - Z axis noise: 2.57 *mg RMS*
